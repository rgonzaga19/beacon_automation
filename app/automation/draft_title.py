Builds the Beacon "Create Draft" remarks/title from a patient's name and
their first/last treatment date, e.g.:

    ABAO JUNE 5, 2026                   (single day — first and last treatment are the same)
    ABAO JUNE 1-10, 2026                (same month)
    ABAO JUNE 28 - JUL 2, 2026          (spans two months — 2nd month abbreviated)

The Beacon draft title field is capped at 50 characters, so the result is
truncated (with a console warning) if it would exceed that.
